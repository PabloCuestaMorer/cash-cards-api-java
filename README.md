# Family Cash Card

This is a simple Spring Boot application that allows parents to manage allowance funds for their children. The application uses a RESTful API to allow parents to create, edit, delete, and view cash cards. The application is also secured with Spring Security to protect it from unauthorized access.

This project was created as part of a course on Spring Boot. The goal of the project was to learn how to use Spring Boot to build a RESTful API. The project also covers the following topics:

- Spring Data
- Spring Security

The project is well-documented and includes unit tests. It is a good starting point for learning how to use Spring Boot to build RESTful APIs.
