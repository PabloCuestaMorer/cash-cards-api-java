# Family Cash Card

This is a simple Spring Boot application that allows parents to manage allowance funds for their children. The application uses a RESTful API to allow parents to create, edit, delete, and view cash cards. The application is also secured with Spring Security to protect it from unauthorized access.

The goal of the project was to learn how to use Spring Boot to build a RESTful API.

- Spring Security

The project is well-documented and includes unit tests.
